# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Description

The Movie Recommendation System is a user-friendly tool designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on a user's input. Built using Python and integrated into a Jupyter Notebook environment, this system allows users to enter the name of a movie and receive a list of recommended films that are similar or relevant.

## Key Features

- **User Input Handling:** Utilizes IPython widgets to create an interactive text input box where users can enter the title of a movie.
- **Data Processing:** Matches the user input with a dataset of movie ratings and recommendations. The dataset includes a list of movies along with their corresponding recommendations based on user preferences and movie similarity.
- **Normalization:** Handles variations in movie title formatting by normalizing both the user input and the dataset entries. This ensures accurate matching even if there are discrepancies in title formatting.
- **Recommendation Display:** Outputs the top four movie recommendations, providing users with a curated list of films to watch next.

## Technical Stack

- **Python:** Used for data manipulation and processing.
- **Pandas:** Handles data operations and filtering.
- **IPython Widgets:** Creates interactive elements within the Jupyter Notebook environment for user input and interaction.

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook Cell:** Execute the code cell to display the input widget.
2. **Enter Movie Name:** Type the desired movie title into the text box and submit.
3. **Receive Recommendations:** View the recommended movies displayed as output, tailored to the entered movie.

## Project Goals

- Provide an intuitive interface for users to get movie recommendations.
- Ensure accurate and efficient processing of movie data.
- Enhance user experience by integrating interactive features into the Jupyter Notebook environment.
